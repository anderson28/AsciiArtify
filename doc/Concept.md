| Kind      | Fast deployment, integrates well with CI pipelines | Limited to container-based operations              |
| K3d       | Efficient resource usage, fast setup               | May have compatibility issues with certain setups  |
    
### Risks of Docker Licensing:
Commercial use restrictions: Commercial use of Docker Desktop requires a subscription (Pro, Team, or Business) if the company has more than 250 employees or more than $10 million in annual revenue. This can create financial constraints for startups and small businesses.
Vendor dependency: Using Docker can create a dependency on a single vendor, which can be problematic for startups just starting out and looking for alternatives to reduce risk.

#### Podman support limitations:
Experimental support for some products: In some cases, Podman support is experimental or does not cover full functionality. This can be a problem for startups that need a stable and reliable containerization solution.

Given the above limitations and risks, it is recommended that you start with Docker as a containerization tool for startups and small businesses. Docker is a popular and well-supported tool that offers a wide range of features and flexibility. As the company grows and finds a stable customer base, it can reevaluate its needs and consider alternative tools, such as Podman, to reduce the risks and limitations associated with the Docker license.

## Key aspects of the recommendation:
1. **Ease of use**: k3d provides a simple and convenient way to deploy an on-premises Kubernetes cluster with minimal involvement and configuration.
2. **Fast cluster deployment**: k3d offers a fast Kubernetes cluster deployment that will allow the AsciiArtify team to quickly get to development and testing of their software product.
3. **GPU support**: k3d supports the use of GPUs, which can be important for the development and testing of machine learning software products.
4. **Active community and support**: Recently, the k3d community has begun to grow rapidly, which is a testament to the growing popularity of this tool. With each improvement and update of the community support, AsciiArtify will have access to new features and solutions for their project.
5. **Using k3d for PoC**: The AsciiArtify team decided to use k3d for their Proof of Concept (PoC). This will allow them to efficiently explore the possibilities of Kubernetes in their project and decide if it meets their needs.
6. **Resource consumption**: k3d is known for its lower resource consumption and performance compared to other tools like minikube and kind

## Conclusion:
Taking into account the above aspects, it is recommended that AsciiArtify use **k3d** for local deployment of a Kubernetes cluster for PoC preparation and further development of the software product.
